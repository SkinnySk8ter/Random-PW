[General Info] - UPDATED
This is the ReadMe File for Homework assignment #3. For this assignment we were tasked with promoting user interaction to store responses in order to generate a random password based off of what the user selected.

[Assignment Details]
When the user arrives at your page they should receive an alert asking them to choose a number between 8-128. After choosing a number between that range the user is then asked a series of questions to help us get a better understanding of what kind of password should be generated. In my example I tried to use the method of having the answers stored and having the ability to click on a "generate password" button and have a random series of characters pop up depending on the choices of the user. For example, if the user chose 50 characters, uppercase letters, and numbers, then the resulting generated password will equal the same set of choices.

I currently have the user inputting an amount for the length. Still working on getting specific options to work such as all capital letters or all integers.

[How To Setup]
The files within this document are going to be updated on a regular basis! However....there are some things to be aware of.

1.The css style sheet is located in the same folder under style.css.

2.All of the pages are linked together so feel free to click away to explore!

4.As stated before, this is a work in progress! Notes on things that have not been worked out yet are marked in green notation (or possibly another color depending on what you prefer).



[Look-Out!]
As stated before the page is still a work in progress! The page is nice and basic with a little bit of CSS to give the page a little bit of order. There are a lot of things that have been commented out as I did not want to lose my train of thought while trying different things to get the code to work with the password generator button. The popups work just fine however. There were a few times where I would try to work on the button and the popups would disappear; resulting in a lot of things being commented out so that way I would not lose any of the thoughts in progress but still have the ability to keep the page up and functioning somewhat. 


update- removed promps. Went with giving one alert to instruct the user about the input boxes instead for easier interaction.
